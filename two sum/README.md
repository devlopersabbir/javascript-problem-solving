# Two Sum

User will give us 2 argument first is a flooting number and second is targeted
number. The target number is sum value. Explain: For example user will gives us

> nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 We have to try with each of every number like,
> asume my answer is `x` so

```
   2 + x = 9
=> x = 9 - 2
   x = 7

   7 + x = 9
=> x = 9 - 7
   x = 2

   11 + x = 9
=> x = 9 - 11
   x = -11

   15 + x = 9
=> x = 9 - 15
   x = -6
```
